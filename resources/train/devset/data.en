$ 10,000 Gold ?
SAN FRANCISCO - It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold .
Lately , with gold prices up more than 300 % over the last decade , it is harder than ever .
Just last December , fellow economists Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini each penned op-eds bravely questioning bullish market sentiment , sensibly pointing out gold 's risks .
Wouldn 't you know it ?
Since their articles appeared , the price of gold has moved up still further . Gold prices even hit a record-high $ 1,300 recently .
Last December , many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for $ 2,000 .
Now , emboldened by continuing appreciation , some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that .
One successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices languished for a more than a decade before the Dow Jones index crossed the 1,000 mark in the early 1980 's .
Since then , the index has climbed above 10,000 .
Now that gold has crossed the magic $ 1,000 barrier , why can 't it increase ten-fold , too ?
Admittedly , getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems .
After adjusting for inflation , today 's price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980 . Back then , gold hit $ 850 , or well over $ 2,000 in today 's dollars .
But January 1980 was arguably a " freak peak " during a period of heightened geo-political instability .
At $ 1,300 , today 's price is probably more than double very long-term , inflation-adjusted , average gold prices .
So what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here ?
One answer , of course , is a complete collapse of the US dollar .
With soaring deficits , and a rudderless fiscal policy , one does wonder whether a populist administration might recklessly turn to the printing press .
And if you are really worried about that , gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge .
Sure , some might argue that inflation-indexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold .
But gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances .
In fact , as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises , This Time is Different , cash-strapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt to non-indexed debt , precisely so that its value might be inflated away .
Even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930 's .
So it can happen anywhere .
Even so , the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it probable , so one should be cautious in arguing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations .
Some have argued instead that gold 's long upward march has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and speculate in gold .
There is probably some slight truth - and also a certain degree of irony - to this argument .
After all , medieval alchemists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold .
Wouldn 't it be paradoxical , then , if financial alchemy could make an ingot of gold worth dramatically more ?
In my view , the most powerful argument to justify today 's high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of Asia , Latin America , and the Middle East into the global economy .
As legions of new consumers gain purchasing power , demand inevitably rises , driving up the price of scarce commodities .
At the same time , emerging-market central banks need to accumulate gold reserves , which they still hold in far lower proportion than do rich-country central banks .
With the euro looking less appetizing as a diversification play away from the dollar , gold 's appeal has naturally grown .
So , yes , there are solid fundamentals that arguably support today 's higher gold price , although it is far more debatable whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future .
Indeed , another critical fundamental factor that has been sustaining high gold prices might prove far more ephemeral than globalization .
Gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest-rate movements .
After all , gold pays no interest and even costs something to store .
Today , with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries , it is relatively cheap to speculate in gold instead of investing in bonds .
But if real interest rates rise significantly , as well they might someday , gold prices could plummet .
Most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict over the short to medium term , with the odds of gains and losses being roughly in balance .
It is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from short-term trends .
Yes , gold has had a great run , but so , too , did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago .
If you are a high-net-worth investor , a sovereign wealth fund , or a central bank , it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events .
But , despite gold 's heightened allure in the wake of an extraordinary run-up in its price , it remains a very risky bet for most of us .
Of course , such considerations might have little influence on prices .
What was true for the alchemists of yore remains true today : gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile .
1929 or 1989 ?
PARIS - As the economic crisis deepens and widens , the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening .
At the start of the crisis , many people likened it to 1982 or 1973 , which was reassuring , because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns .
Today , the mood is much grimmer , with references to 1929 and 1931 beginning to abound , even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional .
The tendency is either excessive restraint ( Europe ) or a diffusion of the effort ( the United States ) .
Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro , whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms .
For geo-strategists , however , the year that naturally comes to mind , in both politics and economics , is 1989 .
Of course , the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall .
Indeed , on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis : the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism .
Yet 2008-2009 , like 1989 , may very well correspond to an epochal change , whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades .
The end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points .
And what happens in 2009 may jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989 , including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist , if not xenophobic , tendencies .
In 1989 , liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc .
For many of his supporters , it was President Ronald Reagan who , with his deliberate escalation of the arms race , pushed the Soviet economy to the brink , thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets .
Of course , there are obvious differences between 1989 and now .
First , and perhaps above all , the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity . By contrast , 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity , but with China substituting for the Soviet Union .
Second , whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear - if more fragile than expected - winners in 1989 , it is difficult in 2009 , with the spread of the global crisis , to distinguish winners from losers .
Everyone seems to be a loser , even if some are more affected than others .
Yet , history is unfair , and the US , despite its greater responsibility for today 's global crisis , may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass .
In better shape , but not alone .
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT , I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes .
One senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe .
From the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard , Asians - Chinese and Indians , in particular - are everywhere , like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC : full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much , and whom they would overcome in the coming decades .
But before this new order appears , the world may be faced with spreading disorder , if not outright chaos .
What , for example , will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries ?
When the rich get less rich , the poor get poorer .
And what about the foreign workers who have reached for the " European dream " and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe 's supposedly open countries ?
The consequences of 1989 ended up being less enduring than many observers , including me , would have assumed .
We can only hope that , in the end , the consequences of 2009 similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now - intuitively and in our historical reflexes - feel them to be .
9 / 11 in Perspective
NEW YORK - It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes , flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center , hit the Pentagon with a third , and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission .
In a matter of hours , more than 3,000 innocent people , mostly Americans , but also people from 115 other countries , had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them .
September 11 , 2001 , was a terrible tragedy by any measure , but it was not a historical turning point .
It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed , or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace .
On the contrary , 9 / 11 has not been replicated .
Despite the attention devoted to the " Global War on Terrorism , " the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies , globalization , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the political upheavals in the Middle East .
As for the future , it is much more likely to be defined by the United States ' need to put its economic house in order ; China 's trajectory within and beyond its borders ; and the ability of the world 's governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth , stemming the spread of nuclear weapons , and meeting energy and environmental challenges .
It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world .
Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best .
They can destroy but not create .
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda .
Moreover , measures have been implemented to push back , successfully , against terrorists .
Intelligence assets have been redirected .
Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient .
International cooperation has increased markedly , in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area .
Military force has played a role as well .
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power .
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad .
Drones - unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered - have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists , including many of the most important leaders .
Weak governments can be made stronger ; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable .
But progress is not to be confused with victory .
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease .
There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men , women , and children in pursuit of political goals .
Indeed , terrorists are advancing in some areas .
