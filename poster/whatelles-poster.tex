\item For some language pairs, pronoun translation is a discourse-driven task which requires information that lies beyond its local context.

\item Inspired by (Hardmeier~et.~al.~2013b), we suggest a neural network-based model using preceding nouns and determiners as feature classes for suggesting antecedent candidates.
\item Our model scores on par with similar models while having a simpler architecture.

\item Features extracted from source context and translation context around the missing pronoun, by encoding a number of word embeddings $n$ words to the left and $m$ words to the right ($n$+$m$).
\item No external anaphora system.
\item We finds the four closest nouns and determiners in English, and use the corresponding French nouns and articles as features.
\item Additionally, we look at the French context of the missing pronoun.
\item Trained using stochastic gradient descent with mini-batches and L2 regularization. Cross-entropy is used as a cost function, with a softmax output layer and embedding sizes of 50.

\begin{compactitem}
\item Results indicate that the model performs on par with similar models, while being easier to train.
\item There are some expected drops in performance for the less common classes heavily dependent on finding their antecedent.
\item A symmetric window size is beneficial, while we are not as sure of why this is the case.
\item Right context seems to be more important than left context, possibly due to the fact that pronouns in their role as subjects largely appears early in sentences.
\item There is potentially too little data for creating robust embeddings, except for in a few reoccurring circumstances.
